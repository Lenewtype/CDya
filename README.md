# react-mobx-seed
This project was start with "Seed project for React + MobX," created by Sapient Global Markets. To it, I've add Firebase and Material-UI.


[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/sapientglobalmarkets/react-mobx-seed.svg)](https://david-dm.org/sapientglobalmarkets/react-mobx-seed)

## Getting started
Create your own project on Github or elsewhere. Then add a git-remote pointing to this repo. Let's name it `mobx-seed`. Merge into your own branch.

```shell
> git remote add mobx-seed https://github.com/sapientglobalmarkets/react-mobx-seed.git
> git pull mobx-seed master
```

At this point you should have all the seed files. Now you can run:
```shell
> npm install
> npm start
```

(Make sure nothing else is running on port 3000. Made that mistake!!)
